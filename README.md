## Content

For ease at finding relevant references, and for contextualization: I have included the course guidance, lessons' PDFs, and bibliographic material as well as each assignment's developed code.

The code has been structured and commented to try being as visual and explicit as possible. Implemented thanks to [these resources](https://gittest2121.gitbook.io/nand2tetris/) (and others...).
